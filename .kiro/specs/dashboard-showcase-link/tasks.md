## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- The implementation is contained within `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` only
- No new dependencies are required - uses existing Next.js Link, Tailwind CSS, and SVG patterns
- Property-based testing is not used for this feature as all requirements test specific UI states and behaviors, not universal properties
- The GlobeIcon pattern should match the existing icon pattern used in the dashboard page
